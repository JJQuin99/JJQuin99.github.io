	<h1>Hi I'm JJ!</h1>
	<p>Most of my free time goes towards in depth analyises of different sagas and stories from TV shows and movies i've watched or videogames i've played through, especially if theyre a whole franchise with different parts. I like to dig deep into plots of stories and characters and why the creators decided to make them the way they are. So I started this website to organize and publicly display my timelines, theories and anaylises.<a href="/about">You can read more about my personal self here!</a></p>
