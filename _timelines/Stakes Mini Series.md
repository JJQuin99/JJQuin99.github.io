## Introduction
"Stakes" the mini series that starts on season 7 episode 6 of Adventure Time kicks off with Marceline comptemplating her immortality and her exsistence as a vampire after an unfortunate situation of being stuck under a tree when her umbrella blows away into the sunlight, out of reach. She then heads to Bonibell to ask if she can cure her vampirism. The experiment ends up being a success, but in turn it brings back from the twice undead 5 of the most powerful vampires that marciline had previously slain hundreds of years earlier. The mini series goes through Marcy's struggle with dealing with her past as well as her new found mortality while simutaniously re-staking and absorbing the powers of her strongest enemies.

Each of the Vampires has their own special power as well as a association to a card in the Tarot that also relates itself to Marceline's current internal struggle. As these enemies are slain, Marcy absorbs their powers as well as comes to peace with the associated issues of the cards each vampire represents. Heres a table, in  order of defeat, with the name of each vampire, their power, and the card they're associated with.

## Analysis
Analysis wise, I'll explain when each Vampire is introduced, then a breif character analysis and how it relates to their card, and finally, relate that card and its meaning to marcy and her current vs previous mindset. 
> **Side Note:** All the Vampire's debut apperences are in the same episode so rather than restating that I'll be listing the episode in which they are staked.

### The Fool
Episode: "Stakes, Part 3: Vamps About"


The Fool is a mischevious, goofy, carefree character who has little worry for his life or whats going on around him. His antics often get him into trouble (evident by his missing tooth, supposidly lost to a box turtle) and he often has a childlike view of the world and situations, not thinking too far ahead if thinking ahead at all.

The characteristics of the fool as well as his abiility to fly is heavily symbolic of his card. The Fool is represented by the number 0 in the Tarot Deck and when Upright is associated with new beginnings, freedom, innocence, and spontinaity. These basic fundamentals of the card match up perfectly with the base representation of The Fool we see in the show. When reversed The Fool's associated meaning becomes, reckless, careless, distracted, naive, and foolish. All of these are also represented by The Fool in the show, most heavily noticed when he is about to die at marcelines hand (with little to no effort from marcy and no effort on The Fools part to escape) and he only responds by asking marceline to smell his feet and that she "won't regret it". These are his final words before being staked and his power of flight being absorbed.  His ability to Fly, and his freedom to fly anywhere, is symbolic not only of the card itself but when absorbed marks the start of Marecline's new journey.

The Fool is the first vampire Marceline slays in the stakes series and centuries prior, he was the first vampire marcy had adimintly tracked down in order to protect the humans who inhabited Ooo at the time. Both times marcy slays The Fool, it starts a new chapter in her life, the beginning of a new adventure for her. This lines up with the Upright meaning of The Fool which is also symbolized by the absorbtion of The Fool's power of flight, giving marcy freedom to fly away unharmed. The Reversed meaning of The Fool acturatly represents Marceline's mindset when she is first intruduced in the beginning of the show and while she was still a vampire. She was reckless and careless, not really considerate of mortals or what effect she had on their lifespan.
